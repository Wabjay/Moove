                            payments right in the Fair app. You have the 
                            option to pay by credit or debit card or link directly to your bank account.</p>

                        <p class="text">Fair accepts the following payment methods for recurring payments:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ACH (Automatic Clearing House)</li>

                    <div>
                        <p class="bold">What is an ACH payment?</p>
                        <p class="text">An ACH payment is a direct 
                            payment that is withdrawn from your bank account. 
                            You can set up ACH in the Fair app by linking directly 
                            to your bank account. Once you set up ACH, your recurring 
                            payment will automatically deduct on your payment date. </p>

                        <p class="bold">Am I required to set up automatic payments?</p>
                        <p class="text">Yes. Fair requires you to set up digital automatic 
                            payments, which you can do easily through the Fair app with a 
                            bank account, debit card or credit card with a valid U.S. address.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p class="bold">What will I owe upfront?</p>
                        <p class="text">At checkout, you’ll make your down payment, your 
                            first monthly payment, and any add-ons you’ve selected in the app, 
                            such as extra miles or excess wear & tear protection. In some cases, 
                            you may also be required to make an additional refundable security deposit. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p class="bold">What is the Down Payment?</p>
                        <p class="text">Our down payment is an upfront fee due at signing and before driving away.
                             The down payment generally covers the costs of initial documentation, registration and
                              licensing fees and has the effect of reducing the cost of monthly payments for the Fair
                               program, which comes with routine maintenance, limited warranty, and roadside assistance
                                included. For our 2 year and 3 year leases, the down payment is the capitalized cost
                                 reduction as in a common lease. The cap cost reduction is an upfront payment that has
                                  the effect of reducing the monthly lease payments for a car.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p class="bold">What does the refundable security deposit cover?</p>
                        <p class="text">The refundable security deposit you may be required to make upfront will
                             be applied toward any amounts due when you return your Fair car, such as tolls & citations,
                            mileage overages or excess wear & tear. If nothing is due, you’ll get your security deposit 
                            back in full.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p class="bold">When is my first monthly payment due?</p>
                        <p class="text">Your first monthly payment is due upfront when you sign your contracts,
                             along with your down payment, any refundable security deposit, and any add-ons you
                              may have purchased, like additional mileage or excess wear & tear protection.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p class="bold">When will my following monthly payments be due?</p>
                        <p class="text">Your monthly payment date is determined by when you get your Fair car. 
                            Once your monthly payment date is locked in, it will remain the same for every month. 
                            For example, if you picked up your car (or the car was delivered) on June 6th, your next payment 
                            will be on July 6th, then August 6th, etc.</p>
                            <p class="text">If you picked up your car (or the car was delivered) on the 29th, 30th, 
                            or 31st of a month, your monthly payment date would be pushed to the 1st of the month and 
                            remain on the 1st of each following month. For example, if you picked up (or the car was 
                            delivered) on June 29th, your next payment would be August 1st, then September 1st, etc.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p class="bold">How much is the late charge?</p>
                        <p class="text">You may incur a late charge for any payment that is not received within 10 
                            days after your due date. The late charge will be $25 or 5% of the amount due, whichever 
                            is lower.</p>

                            security deposit or first monthly payment. Why am I getting an error?</p>
                            <p class="text">If you're getting an error message, check with your bank or 
                                credit card company to make sure:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The dollar amount of available funds matches the total required for your down payment</li>

                            <p class="text">If you've called your bank or credit card company about these issues and still 
                                need further assistance, please don't hesitate to chat with or call us in the app to figure things out.</p>

                        <p class="bold">How does billing work if I return my Fair car in the middle of a billing period?</p>
                        <p class="text">If you paid your first monthly payment at checkout, you are billed in advance so you
                             will receive a prorated credit on your final bill for the unused days.</p>
                        <p class="text">If you did not pay your first monthly payment until a month after receiving your Fair car, 
                             then you are likely being billed in arrears. After returning your car, you will receive a bill that is 
                             prorated to reflect the number of days you had the car since the close of the previous billing cycle.</p>
                        <p class="text">If you’re unsure whether you’re billed in advance or arrears, you can call or chat with a 
                             Fair representative through the app. We're available Monday-Friday from 7a.m.-5 p.m. Pacific, and on 
                             Saturday from 7 a.m.-4 p.m. We're not available on Sundays. You can also email us at <a href="#">support@fair.com.</a></p>

                        <p class="text">From time to time, there are changes in the sales tax that can affect your 
                            monthly payment. These changes affect drivers. Your notification is just a friendly

                            a Fair car. We recommend that you pay your citation, toll or ticket before the due date in order
                             to avoid incurring additional fees. Please note that in order to renew registration, all citations
                              and tolls must be paid in full. If you have other questions regarding a toll or citation, please

                        <p class="text">If you don’t pay a citation or toll, Fair will receive a notice of the 
                            violation and will make the initial payment on behalf of the customer to avoid incurring
                            additional fees or creating interruptions in your subscription. </p>
                            <p class="text">Once the fee (including any penalties from the issuing authority, 
                                if applicable) has been paid by Fair, that amount will be added to your outstanding
